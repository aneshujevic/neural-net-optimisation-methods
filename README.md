# Neural networks optimization algorithms

Implementation of neural network using TensorFlow, Keras and NumPy
with plotting results, so the performance achieved with optimization algorithms can be visually represented.

Optimization algorithms used are RMSProp, Adam, Gradient descent with momentum and are compared to Gradient descent with momentum 0.
